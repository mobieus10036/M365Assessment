# Code of Conduct

## 🤝 Our Commitment

This is a learning project, and everyone is welcome! Whether you're a PowerShell expert or just getting started, I want this to be a friendly and helpful place.

## 💡 Our Standards

### ✅ Please Do:

- **Be respectful and kind** - We're all learning here
- **Be patient** - Remember, everyone has different experience levels
- **Be helpful** - Share your knowledge and help others
- **Be constructive** - If you see a problem, suggest solutions
- **Ask questions** - There are no "dumb questions"
- **Give credit** - If you use someone else's code or ideas, acknowledge them

### ❌ Please Don't:

- **Be mean or rude** - No insults, harassment, or trolling
- **Be dismissive** - Don't make people feel bad for not knowing something
- **Share private info** - Don't post credentials, API keys, or personal data
- **Spam** - Keep discussions relevant to the project

## 🐛 Reporting Issues

If someone is being unkind or violating these guidelines:

1. If you're comfortable, politely ask them to stop
2. If it continues or is serious, please contact me directly through GitHub
3. I'll review and take appropriate action

## 🌟 Examples of Great Behavior

- "Great question! Here's how I solved that..."
- "I'm not sure, but maybe try..."
- "Thanks for catching that bug! Here's a fix..."
- "I'm new to PowerShell, could someone explain how this works?"

## 🔧 Enforcement

As the project maintainer, I reserve the right to:
- Edit or remove comments/contributions that violate these guidelines
- Temporarily or permanently ban contributors who behave inappropriately
- Ask for clarification before taking action

Most issues will be resolved with a friendly conversation. The goal is learning and improvement, not punishment.

## 📚 Attribution

This Code of Conduct is inspired by the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) but simplified for a personal learning project.

## 📞 Questions?

If you're unsure about anything, just ask! I'd rather answer questions than have misunderstandings.
